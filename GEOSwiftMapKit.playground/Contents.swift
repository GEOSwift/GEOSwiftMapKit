//: > _Note:_ Build the GEOSwift framework scheme targeting an iOS Simulator prior to use this Playground.
//: You may have to close and reopen the project after building it.
//: # GEOSwift
//: _The Swift Geographic Engine._
//:
//: Easily handle geographical objects (points, linestrings, polygons etc.) and the main related topographical
//: operations (intersections, overlapping etc.).
//: GEOSwift is basically a MIT-licensed Swift interface to the OSGeo's GEOS library routines*, plus some convenience
//: features for iOS developers as:
//:
//: * A pure-Swift, type-safe, optional-aware programming interface
//: * Automatically-typed geometry deserialization from WKT and WKB representations
//: * MapKit and MapboxGL integration
//: * Quicklook integration
//: * A lightweight GEOJSON parser
//: * Extensively tested
//:
//: ### Handle a geographical data model
//:
//: GEOSwift let you easily create geometry objects for all the geometry types supported by GEOS:
//:
//: * Point
//: * LineString
//: * Polygon
//: * MultiPoint
//: * MultiLineString
//: * MultiPolygon
//: * GeometryCollection
//:
//: Geometries can be deserialized from and serialized back to their Well Known Text (WKT) or Well Known Binary (WKB)
//: representations, as they are defined in the _[Simple features for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)_
//: specification.
//: The default spatial reference system for geometry fields is WGS84 (meaning the SRID is 4326) â€“ in other words, the
//: geometry coordinates are in longitude, latitude pairs in units of degrees.
// Create a POINT from its WKT representation.
let point = try! Point(wkt: "POINT(10 45)")

// A geometry can be created even using the constructor `Geometry.create(WKT)` and casting the returned value to the
// desired subclass.
let geometry1 = try! Geometry(wkt: "POLYGON((35 10, 45 45.5, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10),(20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))")

// The same geometry can be represented in binary form as a Well Known Binary.
let WKB = geometryWKB()
let geometry2 = try! Geometry(wkb: WKB as Data)

if geometry1 == geometry2 && geometry1 != .point(point) {
    print("The two geometries are equal!\nAh, and geometry objects conform to the Equatable protocol.")
}

// Examples of valid WKT geometries representations are:
// POINT(6 10)
// LINESTRING(35 10, 45 45, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10)
// LINESTRING(3 4,10 50,20 25)
// POLYGON((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2))
// MULTIPOINT(3.5 5.6,4.8 10.5)
// MULTILINESTRING((3 4,10 50,20 25),(-5 -8,-10 -8,-15 -4))
// MULTIPOLYGON(((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2)),((3 3,6 2,6 4,3 3)))
// GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(4 6),LINESTRING(4 6,7 10))
//: ### Mapkit integration
//:
//: Convert the geometries to a MKShape subclass, ready to be added as annotations to a MKMapView
//:
let shape1 = MKPointAnnotation(point: point)
let shape2 = try! GeometryMapShape(geometry: geometry1)
let annotations = [shape1, shape2]
//: ### Quicklook integration
//:
//: GEOSwift geometries are integrated with Quicklook!
//: This means that while debugging you can inspect complex geometries and see what they represent: just stop on the
//: variable with the mouse cursor or select the Geometry instance and press backspace in the Debug Area to see a
//: preview.
//: In Playgrounds you can display them just as any other object, like this:
geometry2
//: ### GEOJSON parsing
//:
//: Your geometries can be loaded from a GEOJSON file.
//:
let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()
if let geoJSONURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "multipolygon", withExtension: "geojson"),
    let data = try? Data(contentsOf: geoJSONURL),
    let featureCollection = try? jsonDecoder.decode(FeatureCollection.self, from: data),
    case let .multiPolygon(italy)? = featureCollection.features.first?.geometry {

    italy
//: ### Topological operations:
//:
    try! italy.buffer(by: 1)
    try! italy.boundary()
    try! italy.centroid()
    try! italy.convexHull()
    try! italy.envelope()
    try! italy.envelope().geometry.difference(with: italy)
    try! italy.pointOnSurface()
    try! italy.intersection(with: geometry2)
    try! italy.difference(with: geometry2)
    try! italy.union(with: geometry2)
//: ### Predicates:
//:
    try! italy.isDisjoint(with: geometry2)
    try! italy.touches(geometry2)
    try! italy.intersects(geometry2)
    try! italy.crosses(geometry2)
    try! italy.isWithin(geometry2)
    try! italy.contains(geometry2)
    try! italy.overlaps(geometry2)
    try! italy.isTopologicallyEquivalent(to: geometry2)
    try! italy.relate(geometry2, mask: "T*****FF*")
