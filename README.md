## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+, tvOS 9.2+, macOS 10.9+
* Xcode 10.2
* Swift 5.0

## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Install autotools: `$ brew install autoconf automake libtool`
2. Update your `Podfile` to include:

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'GEOSwiftMapKit'
```

3. Run `$ pod install`

> GEOS is a configure/install project licensed under LGPL 2.1: it is difficult to build for iOS and its compatibility with static linking is at least controversial. Use of GEOSwift without dynamic-framework-based CocoaPods and with a project targeting iOS 7, even if possible, is advised against.

### Carthage

1. Install autotools: `$ brew install autoconf automake libtool`
2. Add the following to your Cartfile:

```
github "GEOSwift/GEOSwiftMapKit" ~> 1.0.0
```

3. Finish updating your project by following the [typical Carthage
workflow](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start).

### Playground

Explore more, interactively, in the playground. It can be found inside `GEOSwiftMapKit` workspace. Open the workspace in Xcode, build the `GEOSwiftMapKit` framework and open the playground file.
